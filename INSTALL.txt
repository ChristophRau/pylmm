Numpy - http://www.numpy.org/

To INSTALL the alpha version of pylmm

1) get pylmm and place it in some directory.  For example $HOME/pylmm, lets
call this directory $PYLMMBASE

2) You should place the module files under $PYLMMBASE/pylmm into some directory that is in your python path.  Or you could just add the following line to your .bash_profile or .bash_rc file in your home directory.

   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PYLMMBASE/pylmm
   
3) If you placed the code in your python path or if you have executed the
export command, then you should be able to access the modules.

Try This: 
import pylmm

FOR HOFFMAN USERS:
If you are using hoffman, then you need to take an additional step. Before
entering a python shell you must type 'module load python'.  This command
gives you access to the numpy and scipy libraries.  It might be a good idea to
also add this command to your .bash_profile or .bash_rc file as well, so that you
don't have to execute the command each time.

If this works, then you installed it correctly.  Try to run the example.py
file in the shell.  The output is not interesting, but if you don't get any
errors, then everything probably worked.

------ USING the Executables -------------------
The executable scripts can be run by invoking python

python $PYLMMBASE/pylmmGWAS.py --help

and 

python $PYLMMBASE/pylmmKinship.py --help
