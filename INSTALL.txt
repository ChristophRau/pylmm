To INSTALL the alpha version of pylmm

1) get pylmm and place it in some directory.  For example $HOME/pylmm
2) add the following line to your .bash_profile or .bash_rc file in your home directory.

   $PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PYLMM_LOCATION/pylmm
   
replace $PYLMM_LOCATION with the location of the root directory for pylmm
($HOME/pylmm in the example so that the full directory would be
$HOME/pylmm/pylmm).

3) Exit the shell and log back in.  Or if you are using a mac, close the shell
and open a new one.  Then open a python shell by simply typing 'python' in the shell and then say

import pylmm

FOR HOFFMAN USERS:
If you are using hoffman, then you need to take an additional step. Before
entering a python shell you must type 'module load python'.  This command
gives you access to the numpy and scipy libraries.  It might be a good idea to
also add this command to your .bash_profile or .bash_rc file as well, so that you
don't have to execute the command each time.

If this works, then you installed it correctly.  Try to run the example.py
file in the shell.  The output is not interesting, but if you don't get any
errors, then everything probably worked.
